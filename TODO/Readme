what is it?
-----------
"todo-list" is a set of PHP scripts that create a web-based list of things to
do.  Items can be added and removed, and are sorted by an assigned priority. 
Also it is possible to assign special tasks to another person and for example
to specify a due date. ToDoList is multilingual (although some languages are 
still under development). Lots of unmentioned features.

"todo-list" was inspired by "todo", some CGI-Scripts, written by Marc
Bayerkohler and Joel Thomas. It was started because I wanted to learn PHP3 and
really needed an easy to use todo-list for the IT-Service-Dep. I worked at.
Max joined in April 2001 and brought a more extensible rewrite of much of it
with him.

System requirements
-------------------
All you need is an PHP-enabled web-server (Apache preferred) and mySQL. It is
developed with a mod_php-Version of PHP and Apache under Linux. When you use the
CGI-Version of PHP you'll have some (smaller) limitations, p.e. remembering the
last person that logged in doesn't work at the moment. Other databases will
(maybe) be supported in the future.


Features
--------
- Assign due-dates, responsible users, etc. to tasks
- Sort TodoList after different columns
- Search
- Graphical Administration of users/projects
- multilingual, every user can use his preferred language. Its really easy to
  add new languages.


How do I install?
-----------------
- put the .php files somewhere where they are accessible by the webserver
- create the database-tables (just run the "databasestructure.sql" in mysql)

  $ mysql -u DBUSER DBINSTANCE < databasestructure.sql

- Login as the admin user, and set up whatever users you need. A "test"-user
  with password "test" is also created as example by the setup sql script.
- with the admin-user you can also create projects and assign members to them.
  Every newly created user is automatically member of project '1' which is
  named - guess it - 'default'. The default-project shouldn't be deleted.
- edit the "include/config.inc"-file to fit your needs.
- Change the password for user "admin"! (Default password is "admin"....)


  
How do I update?
----------------
Please refer to doc/UPDATE for information.
