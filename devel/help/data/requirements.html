The EvoBB requirements are quite simple really!<br><br>

<b>Operating System - ></b>
<br>
<br>
Well when it comes to web servers you cant beat linux, Windows (95,98,nt,me,2000,xp) just aint up there when it comes to stability and support.<br>
I recommend linux but the board has been known to work nicely on Windows 98 ME and 2000 professional. 
<br>
<br>

<b>Web Server - ></b>
<br>
<br>
Apache would be the ideal web server although in most cases any web server will be adequate.
<br>
<br>

<b>PHP- ></b>
<br>
<br>
PHP 3 and above is supported.  PHP 4 is the is the current release so there should be no problems there.
<br>
<br>



<b>Sql Database- ></b>
<br>
<br>
<b>Mysql -></b> Tested extensively and known to work flawlessly
<br>
<b>Ibase -></b> Tested rarely and its stability is not known
<br>
<b>Msql -></b> Tested rarely and its stability is not known
