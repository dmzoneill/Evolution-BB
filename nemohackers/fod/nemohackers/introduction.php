<p>Developers are constantly getting ideas for projects, working them out in their 
  heads and then never finding the actual time to work on them. As the days progress 
  their memory's declines and after a while they have forgotten the idea and nothing 
  comes of it. So here we have the site to collate all projects and discuss and 
  develop all of these useful brain farts.</p>
<p><strong>Nemohackers? Evil!</strong><br>
  Lets start just after the second slybal of that word. Hackers? You mean those 
  nasty geek's who do nothing but send denial of service attacks to the good operations 
  of the world? (ha ha) Those lame ass thirteen year old script kiddies? Uh! No! 
  There is this huge misperception of the word 'hacker', worldwide, probally caused 
  through the propaganda the media throws out each week. They are mistaken. What 
  they actually mean is 'cracker'; causing deliberate damage to to another's computer 
  for personal benefit. We, nemohackers, are a team of experienced programmers 
  and designers writing open source applications with the sole intention of pushing 
  the boundaries of computing. Isn't that what this whole life is about? Advancing?...</p>

<p>In the mean time, enjoy the projects we have documented here, there is some 
  range. Feedback is always more than welcome in the community. Enjoy.</p>
