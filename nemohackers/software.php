  <p><a href="http://www.evobb.com">Evolution BB</a> -  Evolution BB is a new bulletin board designed around a fast PHP backend that is compatible with nearly all SQL servers. It is known to be 60% more efficient with database resources when compared to VBB. It includes real-time chat for any users browsing the forum, language support, threaded/flat forum views, and easy install scripts.  </p>

  <p><a href="software.php?which=liberty">Liberty Network</a> - An internet chat service / protocol with a difference. Messages are encryped not once but twice between sender and recipicant ensuring the sort of security previously enjoyed by only a favoured few.
		A randomly generated 1024bit PGP cipher encrypts outgoing messages to the server, whereupon a further 128bit IDEA encryption is added before onward transmission. Neither participant in the chat session need have any more computer knowledge than they would were they to be using any mainstream messaging service, yet their conversation will be as private as those aboard Air Force one. </p>

  <p><a href="software.php?which=conference">Java Conference</a> - A simple yet effective client / server IM and conference system.</p>

  <p><a href="software.php?which=qpackage">QPackage</a> - A nice package management application for Slackware Linux.</p>
