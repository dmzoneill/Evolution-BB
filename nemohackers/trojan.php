When I here people talk about Linux, somebody always mentions it's 
suppossid immunitity to Virri and Trojan Horse attacks due to it's 
surprisingly simple yet perceptively complex hierarchy of user 
permissions. For those of you who don't know, unlike the Windows systems 
of our world, there is a super user (root) who has access and control 
over every conceivable end of the system. Yes, that's right; root can 
look at what you do. He can stop what you do. Hell, he could even do the 
same if he wanted, but you cannot. For instance, if I were to have a 
regular user account on my friends box, I would probably not have much 
write / read access out of my home directory. (/home/f0d). I wouldn't be 
able to execute many commands from my shell, namingly (rm -r /), and I 
would simply be a standard user of the system. Now can you see the 
problem? Unless an infected file is executed by some ignorant sys-admin 
carelessly surfing as root, there theoretically isn't much chance of 
doing any damage to the system other than what that standard user owns. 
He can of course loose a few of his personal documents mind, but nothing 
which could be classified as 'dangerous' or particuarly 'harmful'. 
So there you have it. That is the explanation giving to most Linux 
users, and it is correct. What is incorrect is saying that there is NO 
WAY of infecting a system. Already you will read of minor polymorphic 
virii now able to infect Unix machines and the spawn of the Open 
Anti-Virus project. (http://www.openvirus.org).

The Linux Trojan Project builds on the fact that we belive it is 
possible. This is not a project growing out of the ass of the subseven 
fan club. This is not a project for the remote misuse of another Linux 
machine, but a project to prove that it can be done, and when done, to 
find ways of stopping it from happening again. If we all just sit here 
and belive what we are told is anything ever going to get better? If I 
had told you that man could not goto the moon, and nobody challenged me, 
would it have ever happened? I think not.

<h4>Current situation</h4>
At the moment we have a working server and a semi-functional client (manipulator). The frontend for the client is writtern in QT thus in theory multi-platform, but is developed on a x86 Linux system.  (QT is a cross-platform C++ widget set, see <a href="http://www.trolltech.com">Trolltech</a> for information).
