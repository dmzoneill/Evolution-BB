EvoBB Installation Instructions


Windows users:

To Install EvoBB look in the install directory and double click the
Setup.exe program and fill in the appropriate information (if you don't
want to use the setup program simply open connect.php and put in the
appropriate values by hand, it will do the same thing).

Then open your ftp client and connect to your host.
Upload this entire directory to the directory that you are installing EvoBB in.

Then open a browser window and surf to 
http://youhost.com/evobbdirectory/install
(surf to the base directory and then add /install on the end)

Give the page the username and password that you would like to have as
the forum administrator.
Give the number of forum groups you would like to have.
Give the names of the groups and how many forums you want in each.
Give the names and descriptions of each of the forums.

If you got through that congrats, you have successfully installed EvoBB.


Unix users:

Same as windows users except you run the Setup file not the Setup.exe file.
