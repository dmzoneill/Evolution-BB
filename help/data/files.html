EvoBB requires little file editing out of the box, but if your one of those people who likes it to look just a perticular way, then some file editing may be needed.  
In this section well address file editing and which files may concern you!<br><br>
Amongst other features EvoBB is equiped with a templating system to allow you to customize your board to the fullest.
<br><br>


<b>Forum Templates -></b><br>
<b>View Topic Templates -></b><br>
<br>


In the forumtemplates and viewtemplates folders of your version you will find 2 files in each. <br>
These files will allow you to change the way you and your visitors view the forum and most of all its easy to do.<br><br>

So lets try our hand at one of these files < default.php > in the viewtemplates<br>
rename it<br>
then open it in whatever program and alter it to<br>
look whatever way you want.  Then see how many columns<br>
the table has that you have made:<br>
ie<br>
&lt;tr&gt;<br>
&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br><br>

would have 1 column. anyway, that little number that<br>
is on a line by itself on the first line as the first<br>
character tells evobb what the colspan of the title <br>
and adminprint cells are so that they go all the way<br>
across. make sure that is there.<br><br>

now, on to something slightly more complicated: the table.<br><br>

in the template file you have<br>
number of columns for table<br>
open table<br>
table contents<br>
close table<br><br>

table contents of all that evobb worries about, and to<br>
help evobb know where the table starts and ends you have<br>
to put a couple special comment like things. [begin] <br>
and [end].<br><br>

so the file now looks like this:<br>
number of columns<br>
open table<br>
[begin]<br>
table contents<br>
[end]<br>
close table<br><br>

if thats what it looks like then you are going good so<br>
far. now all you have to do is put the special tags in<br>
so that things like the post and username will appear<br>
where you want it. if you look at any of the existing<br>
templates in notepad you will see everything that you<br>
have access to make show up wherever you want. it goes<br>
something like<br>
this:<br><br>

[bg] you want to put this as the bgcolor of all the &lt;tr&gt;'s<br>
that you have(alternates)<br><br>

[username] well duh...<br>
[title] ditto<br>
[stars] ditto<br>
[postcount] ditto<br>
[awards] ditto<br>
[views] ditto<br>
[linkmenow] put this where you want the button that displays <br>
the options for the poster.<br>
[posted] this is the date (and time since) this post was posted.<br>
[post] this is the post.<br>
[editpost] put this where you want the edit post button<br>
[pmlink] put this where you want the pm link to be<br>
[replylink] put this where you want the reply link to <br>
be (this is most relevant if you want to reply to a specific <br>
post for threaded mode.)<br><br>


here is a simple template:<br>
1<br>
&lt;table&gt;<br>
[begin]<br>
&lt;tr bgcolor=[bg]&gt;<br>
&lt;td&gt;[username]<br>
[title]<br>
[stars]<br>
[postcount]<br>
[awards]<br>
[views]<br>
[linkmenow]<br>
[posted]<br>
[post]<br>
[editpost]<br>
[pmlink]<br>
[replylink]&lt;/td&gt;<br>
&lt;/tr&gt;<br>
[end]<br>
&lt;/table&gt;<br>
