If the problem is beyond the depth of your knowledge to fix then maybe you could ask for help from the EvoBB team.<br><br>
The EvoBB team reserves the right not to help you in problematic instances. <br>
If they decide that they can help you in a matter, they also reserve the right to charge a modest fee for their services.<br><br>
Charges will depend on the amount of time which the job takes although assessment is free, if they wish to investiagte the matter.<br><br>
Once assessment is complete a description of the possible problem may be given for you to decide what to do.<br>
