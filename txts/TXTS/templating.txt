ok, here is how it works if anyone wants to know:
in http://www.xdweb.net/fod/forum/viewtemplates/ 
there are 3 files. 
Each of those files is a template for viewing threads. 
and there is no php in them, just html so when you
surf to it you will have the full file not just 
the non-php part (cause there is no php in it.).

surf there and get one of the files
rename it
then open it in whatever program and alter it to
look whatever way you want.  then see how many columns
the table has that you have made:
ie
<tr>
<td></td>
</tr>

would have 1 column. anyway, that little number that
is on a line by itself on the first line as the first
character tells evobb what the colspan of the title 
and adminprint cells are so that they go all the way
across. make sure that is there.

now, on to something slightly more complicated: the table.

in the template file you have
number of columns for table
open table
table contents
close table

table contents of all that evobb worries about, and to
help evobb know where the table starts and ends you have
to put a couple special comment like things. [begin] 
and [end].

so the file now looks like this:
number of columns
open table
[begin]
table contents
[end]
close table

if thats what it looks like then you are going good so
far. now all you have to do is put the special tags in
so that things like the post and username will appear
where you want it. if you look at any of the existing
templates in notepad you will see everything that you
have access to make show up wherever you want. it goes
something like
this:

[bg] you want to put this as the bgcolor of all the <tr>'s
that you have(alternates)

[username] well duh...
[title] ditto
[stars] ditto
[postcount] ditto
[awards] ditto
[views] ditto
[linkmenow] put this where you want the button that displays 
the options for the poster.
[posted] this is the date (and time since) this post was posted.
[post] this is the post.
[editpost] put this where you want the edit post button
[pmlink] put this where you want the pm link to be
[replylink] put this where you want the reply link to 
be (this is most relevant if you want to reply to a specific 
post for threaded mode.)


here is a simple template:
1
<table>
[begin]
<tr bgcolor=[bg]>
<td>[username]
[title]
[stars]
[postcount]
[awards]
[views]
[linkmenow]
[posted]
[post]
[editpost]
[pmlink]
[replylink]</td>
</tr>
[end]
</table>
