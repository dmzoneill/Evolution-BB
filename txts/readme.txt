Check the Changelog for changes in this release.

Release alpha 0.2 is experimental and is not stable 
or bug free.  There are still things to be done 
before a 'stable' release is near. When you find a
bug please use our bug tracking system http://www.evobb.com
to report it.  Also, because of the prematurity of the code,
parts are perhaps not as pretty or efficient as they
should be.  This too will be corrected as fast as we can
code it. If you find part of the code that you think
needs to be changed or for which you have a more efficient
way of coding please visit the site and report it.
We will have a suggestions database as well as a bug
tracking database for this purpose.  If we do incorporate
some of your codeinto the system we will give you credit
for it.
